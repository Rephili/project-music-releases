# Music Releases

This project was done by Rosanna Dahlberg and Rebecca Philipson as part of Technigo's Frontend Bootcamp.

The project consisted in building a music release page using React. The goal of the week was to understand the basic concepts of this framework, for example what components and props are and how they work and the main differences between writing code in Vanilla Javascript and React.

## The problem

We started by creating a main app component which we connected to our smaller components: header, album and icons. We displayed the JSX elements for the music albums, like the album cover, the album and the artist name and icons, by using the map method on the array of the data that comes from a downloaded response from the Spotify API. We used Flexbox to make the page responsive. Since it was our first time working with React we learned a lot about how to break up a project in smaller modules/components and how to connect these to one another.
